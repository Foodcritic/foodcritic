# Foodcritic


**⚠️⚠️⚠️ All good things come to an end, and now is the time [to say goodbye to Foodcritic.](https://blog.chef.io/goodbye-foodcritic/) ⚠️⚠️⚠️**

**At this point we consider the Foodcritic project sunsetted and suggest all users move cookbook linting to [Cookstyle](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/).**

**Cookstyle with Chef cookbook support ships in Chef Workstation 0.9+ and ChefDK 4.4+. If you’d like to checkout the project or request new cops visit [github.com/chef/cookstyle](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle/)**
