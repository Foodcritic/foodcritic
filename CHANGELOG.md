[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/compare/v11.1.0...v11.2.0)

- Added a Dockerfile for running Foodcritic in Docker.

## [11.1.0](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/tree/v11.1.0) (2017-05-18)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/compare/v11.0.0...v11.1.0)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Added `FC086` - Use databag helper methods to load data bag items. Tags: style
- Added `FC087` - Library maps provider with deprecated Chef::Platform.set. Tags: chef13 deprecated
- Added `FC088` - Prefer Mixlib::Shellout over deprecated Chef::Mixin::Command. Tags: chef13 deprecated
- Added `FC089` - Prefer Mixlib::Shellout over deprecated Chef::ShellOut. Tags: chef13 deprecated

## [11.0.0](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/tree/v11.0.0) (2017-04-24)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/compare/v10.4.1...v11.0.0)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Added `FC079` to detect the usage of the easy_install_package resource which is deprecated in Chef 13\. Tags: deprecated, chef13.
- Added `FC080` to detect user resources that include the supports property, which is deprecated in Chef 13\. Tags: deprecated, chef13.
- Added `FC081` to detect a cookbook that depends on the partial_search cookbook as partial search functionality is built into Chef 12 and later. Tags: chef12.
- Added `FC082` to detect the usage of node.set and node.set_unless which will be removed in Chef 14\. Tags: deprecated, chef14.
- Added `FC083` to detect execute resources that include the path property, which is deprecated in Chef 12\. Tags: deprecated, chef12.
- Added `FC084` to detect usage of the deprecated Chef::REST class. Tags: deprecated, chef13.
- Added `FC085` to detect usage of new_resource.updated_by_last_action to converge resources. Tags: deprecated, chef13.
- Updated and refactored API methods `declared_dependencies`, `supported_platforms`, and `word_list_values`
- Deprecated API methods `checks_for_chef_solo` and `chef_solo_search_supported?` have been removed.
- Added a new API method `json_file_to_hash` for loading json files as a hash.
- Added a new rake command to run the regression test on just a single cookbook

**Fixed bugs:**

- Multiple rules have been rewritten to use Foodcritic APIs instead of using XPATH queries directly. This avoids false positives created by overly simplistic queries.
- Fixed FC069 to skip if the license metadata is any formatting of 'All Rights Reserved'.
- Added the `license` and `supermarket` tag to FC078.
- Updated the `field` and `field_value` API methods to correctly recognize additional formats of data in the metdata.

## [10.4.1](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/tree/v10.4.1) (2017-04-17)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/compare/v10.4.0...v10.4.1)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Removed the development dependency on github_changelog_generator

**Fixed bugs:**

- Fixed running cucumber tests using the cucumber CLI command
- Fixed FC016 incorrectly firing on custom resources that have no properties. FC016 will now skip over resources that have any actions as those are custom resources and custom resources don't need to declare a default_action.
- Added the missing chef13 tag to FC018
- Updated FC028 to detect both `node.platform_family?` in addition to the existing `node.platform?` usage. This rule has also been renamed and tags updated since the use of `node.platform?` is a style issue and not a correctness issue. Both `node.platform?` and `platform?` are acceptable in cookbooks.
- Fixed FC071 to not alert for cookbooks where the license is 'all rights reserved' in addition to the existing allowed 'All Rights Reserved' string
- Fixed FC071 to detect the LICENSE file if foodcritic is not running in the root of the cookbook
- Fixed FC070 to not alert when platform supports is defined through an array of platforms

## [10.4.0](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/tree/v10.4.0) (2017-04-13)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/compare/v10.3.1...v10.4.0)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Added FC076 to alert when the deprecated `conflicts` metadata is used
- Added FC077 to alert when the deprecated `replaces` metadata is used
- Added FC078 to alert when a non-OSI-approved license is used in metadata. You can disable this rule turning off the new `opensource` tag. For example: `foodcritic -t ~opensource .`

**Fixed bugs:**

- Regression tests now ignore .foodcritic files so we see all possible failures
- FC053 / FC052 updated to properly refer the metadata as deprecated and not unimplemented
- FC071 no longer alerts when cookbooks are licensed as "All Rights Reserved"

## [10.3.1](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/tree/v10.3.1) (2017-04-10)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/compare/v10.3.0...v10.3.1)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Added Chef 13.0.113 metadata, but retained 12.19.36 as the default

**Fixed bugs:**

- Resolved a regression when running Foodcritic as a Rake task

## [10.3.0](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/tree/v10.3.0) (2017-04-10)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Foodcritic/foodcritic/compare/v10.2.2...v10.3.0)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Added `FC069` to ensure standardized licenses are defined in metadata
- Added `FC070` to detect invalid platform supports in metadata
- Added `FC071` to ensure a LICENSE file is included with the cookbook
- Added `FC072` to detect attributes defined in metadata
- Added `FC073` to detect root alias collisions with non-root alias files
- Added `FC074` to detect setting the default_action in a LWRP without using the default_action DSL
- Added `FC075` to detect node.save usage
- Updated `FC008` to fail if the ChefDK generated boilerplate is included
- Updated `FC024` to not recommend adding amazon as an equivalent platform to Redhat as Amazon is its own platform family in Chef 13
- Updated `FC045` to no longer fail if metadata.rb cannot be found
- Added support for the Chef 13 root alias cookbook structure changes defined in <https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc033-root-aliases.md>
- Testing has been completed reworked to simplify testing and allow for far more robust functional tests. Minitest unit tests have been converted to rspec and a new functional testing framework has been added utilizing rspec. Tests for a large number of the existing rules have been converted to this new framework. The new testing framework allows for simple all-in-one tests that are easier to read and much simpler to write. Additionally the regression tests have been reworked, and are now enabled in Travis CI, which will require regeneration of the expected output if new tests are added using `rake regen_regression`. See the readme for additional details on running tests.
